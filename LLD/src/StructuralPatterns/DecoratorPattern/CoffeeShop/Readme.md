Coffee Shop Application Exercise
You are designing a Coffee Shop Application where users can customize their coffee orders by adding ingredients like milk, sugar, whipped cream, and syrups. Each coffee starts with a base cost, and the price increases as more ingredients are added. Use the Decorator Design Pattern to dynamically add ingredients (decorators) to the base coffee. Each ingredient modifies the description and the price of the coffee.



Task:

Implement the Decorator Design Pattern to create a system that allows users to:

Create a base coffee with a fixed cost.

Dynamically add various ingredients (e.g., Milk, Sugar, Whipped Cream) as decorators that adjust the coffee's description and price.

Display the final description and total price of the coffee with all added ingredients.



Output:

After executing the code, the following sequence will be simulated:

A base coffee order will be created.

Multiple ingredients will be added dynamically using the decorator pattern.

The final coffee description and its total price will be displayed.
