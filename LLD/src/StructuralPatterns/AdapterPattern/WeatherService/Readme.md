Weather Service Application Exercise
You are developing a weather application that needs to fetch weather data from multiple sources. The legacy weather service provides weather data in XML format through a getWeatherData() method. However, you also want to incorporate a new third-party weather service that provides data in JSON format using a fetchWeather() method.



Task:

Implement the Adapter Design Pattern to create a system that allows users to:

Use the existing legacy weather service with its getWeatherData() method.

Adapt the new third-party weather service with its fetchWeather()  method for seamless integration.

Retrieve weather data from both services without modifying the existing codebase that relies on the getWeatherData() method.



Output:

After executing the code, it will simulate the following sequence of weather data retrievals:

Retrieve and display weather data from the legacy weather service using XML.

Retrieve and display weather data from the adapted third-party weather service using JSON.

Ensure that both weather services can be used interchangeably while maintaining a consistent interface for the user.
