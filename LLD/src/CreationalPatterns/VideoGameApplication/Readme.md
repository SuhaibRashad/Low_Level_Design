You are designing a Video Game Application where players can create and clone various game characters, such as Warriors, Mages, and Archers. Each character has attributes like:

Name

Health

Attack Power

Defense

To enhance the game's performance and enable players to create new characters quickly, you decide to use the Prototype Design Pattern. This pattern allows characters to be cloned rather than created from scratch, enabling players to modify the attributes of the cloned characters without affecting the original character.



Task:

Implement the Prototype Design Pattern to create a system that allows players to:

Create a prototype character (Warrior, Mage, or Archer) with initial attributes.

Clone the character and modify the attributes of the cloned character.

Display the attributes of both the original and cloned characters to demonstrate their independence from each other.



Output:

After executing the code, it will simulate the following sequence of character manipulations:

Create a prototype character (e.g., a Warrior) with specified attributes.

Clone the character and modify the attributes of the cloned character.

Display the attributes of both the original character and the cloned character, confirming that the changes made to the clone do not affect the original.
